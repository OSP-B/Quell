# Quell

Quell is an easy-to-use, lightweight JavaScript library providing a client- and server-side caching solution and cache invalidation for GraphQL.

Accelerated by [OS Labs](https://github.com/open-source-labs) and developed by [Alex Martinez](https://github.com/alexmartinez123), [Cera Barrow](https://github.com/cerab), [Jackie He](https://github.com/Jckhe), [Zoe Harper](https://github.com/ContraireZoe), [David Lopez](https://github.com/DavidMPLopez),[Sercan Tuna](https://github.com/srcntuna),[Idan Michael](https://github.com/IdanMichael),[Tom Pryor](https://github.com/Turmbeoz), [Chang Cai](https://github.com/ccai89), [Robert Howton](https://github.com/roberthowton), [Joshua Jordan](https://github.com/jjordan-90), [Jinhee Choi](https://github.com/jcroadmovie), [Nayan Parmar](https://github.com/nparmar1), [Tashrif Sanil](https://github.com/tashrifsanil), [Tim Frenzel](https://github.com/TimFrenzel), [Robleh Farah](https://github.com/farahrobleh), [Angela Franco](https://github.com/ajfranco18), [Ken Litton](https://github.com/kenlitton), [Thomas Reeder](https://github.com/nomtomnom), [Andrei Cabrera](https://github.com/Andreicabrerao), [Dasha Kondratenko](https://github.com/dasha-k), [Derek Sirola](https://github.com/dsirola1), [Xiao Yu Omeara](https://github.com/xyomeara), [Nick Kruckenberg](https://github.com/kruckenberg), [Mike Lauri](https://github.com/MichaelLauri), [Rob Nobile](https://github.com/RobNobile) and [Justin Jaeger](https://github.com/justinjaeger).

## Features
- (New!) Quell has now migrated from Node-Redis 3.0 to Node-Redis 4.4. This was a breaking change for how Quell managed the Redis cache but shouldn't change how Quell is implemented!
- (New!) Quell has now migrated from GraphQL V14.x to GraphQL V16.x. This was a breaking change for Quell logic but shouldn't change how Quell is implemented!
- (New!) Quell/server now offers optional depth and cost limiting middleware to protect your GraphQL endpoint! To use, please explore the [@quell/server readme](./quell-server/README.md).
- (New!) Server-side caching now properly handles fragments and individually caches each datapoint. 
- (New!) Server-side cache now caches entire queries in instances where it is unable to cache individual datapoints. 
- (New!) Server-side cache will properly join partial responses where the database and cache have different datapoints for the same query.
- Cache Invalidation implemented in server-side for (add, update, and delete) mutations
- Client-side caching utilizing LokiJS
- Server-side caching utilizing a configurable Redis in-memory data store with batching
- Partial and exact match query caching
- Programmatic rebuilding of GraphQL queries to fetch only the minimum data necessary to complete the response based upon current cache contents
- A easy-to-use Chrome Developer Tools extension designed for Quell users. With this extension, users can:
  - Inspect and monitor the latency of client-side GraphQL/Quell requests
  - Make and monitor the latency of GraphQL/Quell requests to a specified server endpoint
  - View server-side cache data and contents, with the ability to manually clear the cache
  - Features require zero-to-minimal configuration and can work independently of `@quell/client` and `@quell/server`

## Installation

### Quell-Client and Quell-Server

Quell is divided into two npm packages:

- Download @quell/client from npm in your terminal with `npm i @quell/client`
- Download @quell/server from npm in your terminal with `npm i @quell/server`


#### Usage Notes

- Currently, Quell can cache 1) query-type requests without variables or directives and 2) mutation-type requests (add, update, and delete) with cache invalidation implemented. Quell will still process other requests, but will not cache the responses.

### Quell Developer Tool

Quell Developer Tool is currently available as a Chrome Developer Tools extension. The easiest way to get it is to [add it from the Chrome Web Store.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quell-developer-tool/jnegkegcgpgfomoolnjjkmkippoellod)
